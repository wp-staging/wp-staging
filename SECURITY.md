# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

currently being supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

WP Staging, being a major backup plugin in the WordPress environment, 
prioritizes its security immensely. Acknowledging that complete coverage of all 
security aspects is challenging, we encourage our users and the security 
community to directly communicate any security-related discoveries to us. 
This article will guide you on submitting your reports, 
the applicable guidelines, and the rewards you can expect for your contributions.
