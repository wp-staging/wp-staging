#Contribute To WP Staging

Community made patches, localisations, bug reports and contributions are always welcome.

When contributing please ensure you follow the guidelines below so that we can keep on top of things.

__Please Note:__ GitHub is for bug reports and contributions only.

## Getting Started

* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Raise it on our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/WP-Staging/wp-staging/issues)
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce the bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue as well as the version of WordPress you're using.

## Making Changes

* Fork the repository on GitHub
* Make the changes to your forked repository
* Ensure you stick to the PSR standard
* When committing, reference your issue (if present) and include a note about the fix
* (coming soon) If possible, and if applicable, please also add/update unit tests for your changes 
* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request to the 'master' branch of the WP Staging repository

## Code Documentation

* We ensure that every WP Staging function is documented well and follows the standards set by phpDoc
* An example function can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/rene-hermenau/8d3d7ee0633ee2f64b4b)
* Please make sure that every function is documented so that when we update our API Documentation it will complete
* If you're adding/editing a function in a class, make sure to add `@access {private|public|protected}`
* Finally, please use tabs and not spaces. The tab indent size should be 4 for all WP Staging code.

At this point you're waiting on us to merge your pull request. We'll review all pull requests, and make suggestions and changes if necessary.
