<strong>Troubleshooting Backup & Cloning</strong>
[https://wp-staging.com/docs/category/troubleshooting/](https://wp-staging.com/docs/category/troubleshooting/ "Troubleshooting Backup & Cloning")

<strong>Change your workflow of updating themes and plugins:</strong>

1. Use WP STAGING to clone a production website for staging, testing, or backup purposes
2. Create a backup of your website
3. Customize the theme, configuration, update or install new plugins
4. Test everything on your staging site and keep a backup of the original site
5. If the staging site works 100%, start the migration and copy all updates to your production site!
6. If something does not work as expected, restore the previous backup

<h3> CanÂ´t I just use my local WordPress development system like xampp / lampp for testing and backup purposes? </h3>

You can always test your website locally, but if your local hardware and software environment is not a 100% exact clone of your production server, there is NO guarantee that every aspect of your local copy works on your production website exactly as you expect it.

There are noticeable differences like the PHP version or the server your website is running under. Still, even such non-obvious settings like the amount of RAM or the CPU performance can lead to unexpected results on your production website.

There are dozens of other reasons why a local test website will never mimic the production site server. That's why a successful local test or backup site is no guarantee that the site will run in the production environment as expected.

That is where WP STAGING shows its strengths... Site cloning, backup, and staging site creation simplified. WordPress cloning on an enterprise-ish level!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I use a Backup & Staging Website? =

Plugin updates and theme customizations should be tested on a staging / backup platform before applying them on the production website.
Usually, it's recommended having the staging / backup platform on an identical server like the production server. You can only catch all possible errors during testing with the same hardware and software environment for your test & backup website.

So, before you update a plugin or install a new one, it is highly recommended to check out the modifications on a clone / backup of your production website.
That ensures that any modifications work on your production website without throwing unexpected errors or preventing your site from loading, better known as the "WordPress blank page error."

Testing a plugin update before installing it in a production environment isn't done very often by most users because existing staging solutions are too complex and need a lot of time to create a
an up-to-date copy of your website.

You could be afraid of installing plugins updates because you follow "never touch a running system." You know that untested updates increase the risk of breaking your site.

That's is one of the main reasons WordPress installations are often outdated, not updated at all, and insecure because of this non-update behavior.

<strong> It's time to change this, so there is no easier way than using "WP STAGING" for cloning, backup, and migration of your WordPress website.</strong>

= How to install and set up a staging site / site backup? =
Install WP STAGING backup via the admin dashboard. Go to 'Plugins', click 'Add New' and search the plugins for 'WP STAGING'. Install the plugin with 'Install Now'.
After installation, go to WP STAGING > Staging Sites and create your first staging / backup site

= Is WP STAGING a backup plugin? =
Even though you can use WP STAGING for backup purposes, the free version is not a usual backup plugin per the general definition. WP STAGING creates a clone of your entire website, which you can immediately use for developing and testing.
You can even use it as some kind of backup in case something happens to your production site, but only the WP STAGING | PRO pro version allows you to download the backup to your local computer. There are many other popular backup plugins out there. Still, our goal is to bring the reliability and performance of a backup plugin to a new level.

So instead of offering our backup feature free of charge, we think it's time to provide a full-fledged premium backup solution with enterprise code quality affordable for everyone.

= What is the difference between WP STAGING backup and other backup plugins? =

----------------------------------------------
Note: WP STAGING | PRO provides more advanced backup functionality compared with the below-mentioned backup plugins. The speed and Performance of WP STAGING's backup feature often exceed even the most prominent and most well-established backup plugins.
We are now adding more advanced backup features to deliver what other existing backup plugins are still missing.
----------------------------------------------

You may have heard about other popular backup plugins like All in one Migration, BackWPUp, BackupWordPress, Simple Backup, WordPress Backup to Dropbox, or similar WordPress backup plugins and now wonder about the difference between WP STAGING and those backup tools.

Other backup plugins usually create a backup of your WordPress filesystem and a database backup that you can use to restore your website if it becomes corrupted or you want to go back in time to a previous state.

The backup files are compressed and can not be executed directly. WP STAGING, on the other hand, creates a full backup of the whole file system and the database in a working state that you can open like your original production website.

Even though WP STAGING's basic version comes with some backup capabilities, its main purpose is to create a clone of your website, which you can work on. It harmonies very well with all the mentioned backup plugins above. If you go with the WP STAGING | PRO version, you will get the backup functionality of the mentioned above backup plugins.

Note, that some free backup plugins are not able to support custom tables. (For instance, the free version of Updraft plus backup plugin). In that case, your backup plugin is not able to create a backup of your staging site when it is executed on the production site.
The reason is that the tables created by WP STAGING are custom tables beginning with another table prefix.
To bypass this limitation and to be able to create a backup of your staging site, you can set up your backup plugin on the staging site and create the backup from that location. That works well with every available WordPress backup plugin.

= I want to backup my local website and copy it to production and another host =
If you want to migrate your local website to an already existing production site, you can use our pro version WP STAGING | PRO or a tool like WP Migrate DB that copies only the database.
WP STAGING is intended to create a staging site with the latest data from your production site or create a backup of it.

= What are the benefits compared to a migration and backup plugin like Duplicator? =
We like the Duplicator plugin. Even though Duplicator is not as fast as WP STAGING for creating a backup,  it's still is a great tool for migrating from a development site to production one or from production site to development one. Overall it's a good tool to create a backup of your WordPress website.
The downside is that before you can even create an export or backup file with Duplicator, a lot of adjustments, manual interventions, and requirements are needed before you can start the backup process.
The backup plugin Duplicator also needs some skills to be able to create a backup and development/staging site. In contrast, WP STAGING does not need more than a click from you to create a backup or staging site.
Duplicator is best placed to be a tool for the first-time creation of your production site. That is something where it is convenient and powerful.

If you have created a local or web-hosted development site and you need to migrate that site the first time to your production domain, you do nothing wrong by using
the Duplicator plugin! If you need all your latest production data like posts, updated plugins, theme data, and styles in a testing environment or want to create a quick backup before testing out something, then we recommend using WP STAGING instead!

If speed, performance, and code quality are a matter for you as well, give WP STAGING a try.

= I can not log in to the staging / backup site =
If you are using a security plugin like Wordfence, iThemes Security, All In One WP Security & Firewall, or a plugin that hides the WordPress default login URL, make sure that you have installed the latest version of WP STAGING to access your cloned backup site.
Suppose you can still not log in to your staging / backup site. In that case, you can go to WP STAGING > settings and disable there the WP STAGING extra authentication. Your admin dashboard will still be protected and not accessible to public users.

= Can I activate permalinks on the staging / backup site? =

Permalinks are disabled on the staging / backup site after first time cloning / backup creation
[Read here](https://wp-staging.com/docs/activate-permalinks-staging-site/ "activate permalinks on staging site") how to activate permalinks on the staging site.

= How to use a Backup file to Migrate WordPress Backup to another Host or Domain
The pro version of WP STAGING can backup your whole WordPress website. (In the future, we are implementing a basic free version of our sophisticated backup feature into this free version as well)
With this backup function, you can backup and copy your entire WordPress website to another domain, new host, or new server very easily, and often faster and more reliable than with any other existing backup plugins.
Have a look at [https://wp-staging.com/docs/how-to-migrate-your-wordpress-site-to-a-new-host/](this article), that introduces the backup feature.

= Can I give you some feedback for WP STAGING Backup & Cloning? =
This plugin has been created in thousands of hours and works even with the smallest shared web hosting package.
We also use an enterprise-level approved testing coding environment to ensure that the cloning and backup process runs rock-solid on your system.
If you are a developer, you will probably like to hear that we use Codeception and PHPUnit for our backup software.
