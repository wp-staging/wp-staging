/**
 * The base class that models a Service Provider that will completely provide a feature or not.
 *
 * Feature Service Providers will differ from normal providers in that they completely manage
 * a feature and all the required bindings and hooks. Feature Providers follow the concept of a
 * truthy constant to enable them, and a falsy value environment variable to disable them if activated.
 * This allows Feature Providers to launch a feature "darkly" by simply not setting their trigger constant,
 * once launched, users can disable the feature either by setting en environment variable with the same
 * name as the constant to a falsy value or by setting the constant to `false` in their `wp-config.php` file.
